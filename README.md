===============

This is a Qt5 widget application included in the "Getting started with Simulink" book: http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-simulink/book

A Simulink cruise controller model should be used.

Input files:
 * throttle

Output files:
* current speed
* target speed

Controls:
* slider to set the target speed


Requirements
------------

The Qt5 framework must be present to compile this application.

I used Qt Creator, so I'm including its files as well.
